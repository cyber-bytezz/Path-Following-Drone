# Path Following Drone in CoppeliaSim

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for a path-following drone simulation in CoppeliaSim. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of path-following algorithms for drones within a simulated environment.

## Features

- [x] Path generation and visualization.
- [x] PID controller for altitude and position control.
- [x] Dynamic obstacle avoidance.
- [x] Interactive GUI for user input and visualization.

## Prerequisites

- [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) - Make sure to have CoppeliaSim installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/path-following-drone.git
```
Open the CoppeliaSim scene file path_following_drone.ttt.

- Start the simulation in CoppeliaSim.

- Run the control script path_following_drone_control.lua.

# Usage
- Use the GUI to set the desired path and parameters.
- Press the "Start" button to initiate the drone's movement along the specified path.
# Configuration
- config.yaml: Contains configuration parameters for the drone's behavior and control.
# Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
